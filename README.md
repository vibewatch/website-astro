# AI Pulse Daily

AI Pulse Daily — surfacing themes, pain points, and emerging topics from the social web.

## Overview

This project powers [genisisiq.com](https://genisisiq.com/), a static site that publishes daily analysis reports from social media platforms. Reports are auto-discovered from date-named Markdown files and presented with interactive calendars and topic cards. The site is bilingual (English + Simplified Chinese) and ships with a built-in search index and RSS feed.

## Tech Stack

- **[Astro 5](https://astro.build/)** — static site generator
- **[Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)** — client-side search (runs as a build step over `dist/`)
- **Node ≥ 22**

Generated `pagefind/` files are emitted into `dist/pagefind/` during the build and served from the deployed site.

## Adding Content

Create a new date-named Markdown file under `docs/<source>/<topic>/` (e.g. `docs/reddit/ai-agent/2026-04-12.md`). The site auto-discovers it — no config changes needed. Chinese translations live alongside the English file with a `.zh.md` suffix.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4321
npm run build    # astro build && pagefind --site dist
npm run preview  # serve ./dist locally
```

The full `npm run build` runs Astro and then Pagefind in sequence. Use `npm run build:site` to skip Pagefind during fast iteration.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `deploy-site.yml` | Push to `main` (Astro src/config changes) | Builds the Astro site, runs Pagefind, deploys to GitHub Pages, and notifies subscribers when new report files are added. |
| `build-reddit-reports.yml` | Cloudflare / manual | Generates daily Reddit analysis reports and syncs them into `docs/reddit/`. |
| `build-twitter-reports.yml` | Cloudflare / manual | Generates daily Twitter analysis reports and syncs them into `docs/twitter/`. |
| `build-hackernews-reports.yml` | Cloudflare / manual | Generates daily HackerNews analysis reports and syncs them into `docs/hackernews/`. |
| `build-youtube-reports.yml` | Cloudflare / manual | Generates daily YouTube analysis reports and syncs them into `docs/youtube/`. |
| `build-source-reports-reusable.yml` | Reusable workflow | Shared implementation for English source report generation and website sync. Excludes `.zh.md` translations. |
| `translate-reports-to-chinese.yml` | Cloudflare / manual | Translates English reports into Chinese (`.zh.md`) and syncs them into `docs/`. |

### Cloudflare Scheduler

The `cloudflare/` Worker owns the cron schedule and dispatches the report workflows through the GitHub Actions API. Native GitHub Actions `schedule` triggers are left commented in the workflow files as references, while `workflow_dispatch` remains the execution entrypoint.

From `cloudflare/`, deploy it with Wrangler:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
npx wrangler deploy
```

Use a fine-grained GitHub PAT with **Actions: Read & Write** access on `vibewatch/vibewatch.github.io`. `GITHUB_REPO` is stored as a non-sensitive Worker var in `cloudflare/wrangler.toml`. `GITHUB_REF` is optional, defaults to `main`, and can also be set as a Worker var if dispatches need to target another ref.

### Report Generation Pipeline

The English source workflows (`build-reddit-reports`, `build-twitter-reports`, `build-hackernews-reports`, `build-youtube-reports`) call `build-source-reports-reusable.yml` with source-specific inputs. The shared workflow follows this pattern:

1. Fetch raw JSON data collected from the source platform.
2. Generate or translate Markdown reports using **Copilot CLI**.
3. Copy the new English Markdown files into this repo's `docs/` directory, excluding `.zh.md` translations.
4. Push to `main`, which triggers the `deploy-site.yml` deploy workflow.

The `translate-reports-to-chinese.yml` workflow handles `.zh.md` translations separately.

### Newsletter Notification

The `notify-subscribers` job in `deploy-site.yml` runs after deployment on push events:

1. Compares `HEAD~1..HEAD` to detect **newly added** English report files (excludes `.zh.md` translations).
2. Builds an HTML email with links to each new report on `genisisiq.com`.
3. Sends the email to subscribers via a newsletter worker API.

Newsletter delivery is optional: the job skips sending when newsletter secrets are missing, and notification delivery errors do not fail the site deployment.

## Deployment

Built to `dist/` and deployed to GitHub Pages at [genisisiq.com](https://genisisiq.com/).
